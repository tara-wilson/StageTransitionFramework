 This is a view controller I put together for a client for an app that displays music events.
 
 The main model is an event object which you can see more information on at the bottom of the file
 
 Most of this VC is related to UI. The event model object already exists when the view is entered, the view's components just need to be displayed in the scrollview
 
 A large part of this vc is using autolayout to display these ui elements - the autolayout was done a bit strangely because the client changed the desired order of the ui elements ALL THE TIME...fun.....
 
 So the vc was done this way to make swapping around items a breeze
 
 I don't use storyboard, all of my ui items and constraints are done programatically
 
 I know there are easier ways to do constraints (I like easypeasy) but when I went to rewrite this VC I knew I needed a code sample so I didn't want to integrate too many libraries.
 
 The app this is used for is in production so to see this in action go to
